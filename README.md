## 📝 API Integration Guide

### Connecting to Real APIs

To connect to actual Pritchard Companies APIs:

1. Replace mock data generators in `src/data/mockData.ts`
2. Implement API service layer in `src/services/`
3. Add authentication handling
4. Update data fetching hooks
5. Configure error handling and loading states

### Example API Service

```typescript
// src/services/pritchardCompaniesApi.ts
export class PritchardCompaniesApiService {
  async pullDeals(): Promise<Deal[]> {
    const response = await fetch('/api/deals');
    return response.json();
  }
  
  async pushDeal(deal: Deal): Promise<void> {
    await fetch('/api/deals', {
      method: 'POST',
      body: JSON.stringify(deal)
    });
  }
}
```

## 🧪 Testing

### Running Tests
```bash
# Run all tests
pnpm test

# Run tests in watch mode
pnpm test:watch

# Run tests with coverage
pnpm test:coverage
```

### Writing Tests
- Use React Testing Library for component tests
- Test user interactions, not implementation details
- Aim for high test coverage (>80%)
- Mock external dependencies

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Build Errors**
- Ensure `src/index.css` contains `@import "tailwindcss"`
- Check TypeScript types and import paths
- Verify all dependencies are installed

**Runtime Errors**
- Check browser console for error messages
- Verify component props match TypeScript interfaces
- Ensure mock data is properly generated

**Styling Issues**
- Confirm Tailwind CSS is properly configured
- Check CSS variable definitions in `src/index.css`
- Verify component className props
