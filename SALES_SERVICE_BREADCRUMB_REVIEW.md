# Sales and Service Breadcrumb Icon Review

## Overview
This document provides a comprehensive review of the sales and service breadcrumb icons in the dealership dashboard application, including the issues found and improvements made.

## Issues Identified

### 1. **Icon Inconsistency Between Sidebar and Breadcrumbs**
- **Problem**: Sidebar navigation and breadcrumb navigation used different icons for the same sections
- **Impact**: Confusing user experience and inconsistent visual language
- **Example**: Sales Deals showed `CreditCard` in breadcrumbs but `FileText` in sidebar

### 2. **Inappropriate Icon Choices**
- **Problem**: Some icons didn't clearly represent their function
- **Impact**: Users couldn't quickly understand what each section does
- **Example**: Inventory using `Car` instead of `Package` (inventory management)
